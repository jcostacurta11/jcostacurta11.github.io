* ### Designing Feedback Controllers for Human-Prosthetic Systems Using H-Infinity Model Matching ([Paper](/files/EMBC_paper.pdf), [Slides](/files/CM night slides.pdf))

   Ongoing work in Neuromedical Control Systems Lab, concerning the use of optimal control theory in providing sensory feedback to upper-limb prosthesis users. Slides are from 2019 Computational Medicine Night talk.
   
   Conference paper: J. Costacurta, L. Osborn, N. Thakor, and S. Sarma, “Designing feedback controllers for human-prosthetic systems using h-infinity model matching,” in 2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), 2018, pp. 2316 – 2319.
   
* ### Machine Learning Methods for Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations ([Slides](/files/FUSRP_Final_Presentation (6).pdf))

   Conducted summer research on numerical methods for PDE solving as part of 2019 Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program at Fields Institute/University of Toronto. Presented slides at end-of-summer symposium. 

* ### An interactive module for teaching biomedical applications of feedback control theory ([Link](https://jcostacurta11.shinyapps.io/code/), [Poster](/files/CER Poster (1).png))

   Received JHU Center for Educational Resources (CER) funded fellowship to develop interactive applet for course EN.580.222 Systems and Controls. Presented poster at 2019 Biomedical Engineering Society Conference.
   
* ### Effect of Ankle-Foot Orthosis Stiffness on Muscle Coordination During Transient Walking in Healthy Adults ([Poster](/files/Costacurta reu poster.pdf))

   Conducted summer research on assistive devices as part of 2018 Center for Neurotechnology REU at University of Washington. Presented poster at end-of-summer symposium.
