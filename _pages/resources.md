# PhD Resources
Here are some resources I've found helpful, both for applying to graduate programs and for surviving/thriving once you start:
* [Some modest advice for graduate students](http://neuromechanicslab.emory.edu/documents/advice-docs/ModestAdviceGradStudents.pdf)
* [Velocity in research](http://agriblog.stanford.edu/slides/07-velocity.pdf)
* [Previous NSF GRFP winning examples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoezGhbtcpg3BvNdag2F5dTQM-Xl2EELUgAfG1eUg0s/htmlview#gid=0)
* [Negotiating graduate financial aid](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13F9x5YMCFTZycR21jnhBTD_nPGdyu1aKKVw0aDNy8HY/edit?invite=COvEzY0I)
* [Big list of graduate funding sources](https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/graduate/)

# Machine Learning Resources
Here are some websites that may be helpful for self-teaching.
* R2D3's [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)
* Victor Zhou's post on [Intro to Neural Networks (with code)](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/)
* Chris Olah's post on [Neural Nets, Manifolds, and Topology](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/)

# Motivation/Fun Stuff
* Olivia Walch's [Some Myths About Math](http://oliviawalch.com/files/smam.pdf)
* Ashley Juavinett's [There's No Such Thing as a Computational person](https://medium.com/the-spike/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-computational-person-cca658b5c8f9)
