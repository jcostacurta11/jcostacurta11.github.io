# PhD Application Resources
Here are some resources I've found helpful, both for applying to graduate programs and for surviving/thriving once you start:
* [Some modest advice for graduate students](http://neuromechanicslab.emory.edu/documents/advice-docs/ModestAdviceGradStudents.pdf)
* [Velocity in research](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs197/slides/05-02-velocity.pdf)
* [Previous NSF GRFP winning examples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoezGhbtcpg3BvNdag2F5dTQM-Xl2EELUgAfG1eUg0s/htmlview#gid=0)
* [Negotiating graduate financial aid](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13F9x5YMCFTZycR21jnhBTD_nPGdyu1aKKVw0aDNy8HY/edit?invite=COvEzY0I)

# Machine Learning Resources
Here are some websites that may be helpful for self-teaching.
* [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)
* [Intro to Neural Networks (with code)](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/)
