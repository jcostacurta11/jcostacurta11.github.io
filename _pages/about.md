Hi there! My name is Julia and I'm a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 2020 with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, Mathematics, and Applied Mathematics and & Statistics. In general, I'm interested in how we can apply mathematical concepts (control theory, topology, dynamical systems...) to biomedical problems, especially those involving the brain. I've previously worked in the JHU [Neuromedical Control Systems Lab](https://sarmalab.icm.jhu.edu/), University of Washington [Ability and Innovation Lab](https://steelelab.me.uw.edu/) and Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences. If any of this sounds interesting to you feel free to contact me! 

Outside of STEM I enjoy fiction writing, Jane Austen, cooking, reading, and gardening.
