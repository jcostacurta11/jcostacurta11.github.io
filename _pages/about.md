Hi there! My name is Julia and I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor in Statistics at Haverford College. I got my PhD in 2025 at Stanford, where I worked with [Scott Linderman](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/) on developing and fitting statistical models to uncover structure of neuroscience-related datasets. I received graduate funding from the [Stanford DARE Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/dare), [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [Sang Samuel Wang SGF](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf), and [Stanford EDGE](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/enhancing-diversity-graduate) fellowship.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 2020 with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, Mathematics, and Applied Mathematics and & Statistics. I've previously worked in the JHU [Neuromedical Control Systems Lab](https://sarmalab.icm.jhu.edu/), University of Washington [Ability and Innovation Lab](https://steelelab.me.uw.edu/), and [Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/2019-fusrp). 

Outside of STEM I enjoy reading, sewing, and rock climbing. If any of this sounds interesting to you feel free to [contact me](mailto:jcostac@stanford.edu)! 

Many thanks to [EJ Chong](https://ejchong.com/) for the icon!
