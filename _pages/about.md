Hi there! My name is Julia and I'm a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. In general, I'm interested in how we can apply mathematical concepts (control theory, topology, dynamical systems...) to biomedical problems, especially those involving the brain. I'm honored to currently receive funding from the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [Sang Samuel Wang SGF](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf), and [Stanford EDGE](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/enhancing-diversity-graduate) fellowship.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 2020 with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, Mathematics, and Applied Mathematics and & Statistics. I've previously worked in the JHU [Neuromedical Control Systems Lab](https://sarmalab.icm.jhu.edu/), University of Washington [Ability and Innovation Lab](https://steelelab.me.uw.edu/), and [Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/2019-fusrp). 

Outside of STEM I enjoy fiction writing, Jane Austen, cooking, reading, and gardening. If any of this sounds interesting to you feel free to [contact me](mailto:jcostac@stanford.edu)!
