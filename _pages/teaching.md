## Teaching
* ### Instructor of Record, ENGR 108: Introduction to Matrix Methods
In summer 2024, I taught my own course as instructor of record! I had the pleasure to teach [ENGR 108: Introduction to Matrix Methods](https://web.stanford.edu/class/engr108/), an upper-level undergraduate course in applied linear algebra. Throughout the summer, we learned foundational topics in linear algebra for computation, building up to least-squares model fitting. Along the way, we also practiced implementing what we learned in Python.
* ### Stanford Summer Engineering Academy
In spring/summer 2023, I prepared and taught a four-week [inquiry-oriented linear algebra](https://iola.math.vt.edu/index.php) course for [Stanford Summer Engineering Academy](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/equity-and-inclusion-initiatives/undergraduate-programs/stanford-summer), a four-week summer bridge program attended by first-generation/low-income and underrepresented incoming freshmen.
* ### Graduate Teaching Assistantships
[DATASCI 112, Introduction to Data Science](https://web.stanford.edu/class/datasci112/), Winter 2024
[ENGR 108, Introduction to Matrix Methods](https://web.stanford.edu/class/engr108/), Fall 2023
* ### Stanford Carpentries
I teach and assist with workshops on programming in Python and R via the Stanford Carpentries, and hold a teaching certification from the international [Carpentries network](https://carpentries.org/).
* ### Center for Teaching and Learning
I served as an Engineering Learning Consultant in Stanford's [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://studentlearning.stanford.edu/academic-skills/peer-learning-consultant-program/meet-team) from 2022-2024. In this role I helped develop workshops on data visualization and LaTeX. I also taught as a co-instructor for a scientific Python bootcamp offered to visiting students in the Stanford Equity & Inclusion Office's summer programs.
* ### Stanford Climbing Wall
I taught belay classes, clinics, and quarter-long introductory courses at the [Stanford Climbing Wall](https://rec.stanford.edu/adventure/climbing).
* ### Additional Calculus for Engineers
In Fall 2021, I held drop-in help hours for students enrolled in CME 102, Ordinary Differential Equations for Engineers, via Stanford's [Additional Calculus for Engineers](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/equity-and-inclusion-initiatives/undergraduate-programs/additional-calculus) program.
* ### BEAM Summer Away
In July 2020, I served as a counselor and teaching assistant for [BEAM Summer Away](https://www.beammath.org/summer-after-7th-grade) (online due to COVID), a program aimed at helping students from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds gain the resources necessary to succeed mathematically. I assisted with courses on number theory and projective planes, and led activities and check-ins with the students.
* ### Undergraduate Teaching Assistant Positions
In my work as an undergrad TA, I've taught section, graded HW/exams, and held office hours for the following courses:
*  Calculus III (AS.110.202): Fall 2019
*  Systems and Controls (EN.580.222): Spring 2019, Spring 2020
*  Differential Equations and Applications (AS.110.302): Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Spring 2020 

I am very proud to have received awards for my undergrad teaching from both the BME and mathematics departments.


## Mentoring
I serve as a mentor for undergraduate students and prospective graduate students via [Project SHORT](https://www.project-short.com/), JHU [Womxn Mentoring Whiting](https://jhuwmw.carrd.co/), Stanford [SWIMM](http://swimm.stanford.edu/), and the Stanford [WCC STEM Program](https://stanfordwcc.weebly.com/wcc-stem-program.html).

Many thanks to my own mentors, who have shaped my experience in academia for the better.
