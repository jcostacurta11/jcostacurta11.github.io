### BEAM Summer Away
In July 2020, I served as a counselor and teaching assistant for [BEAM Summer Away](https://www.beammath.org/summer-after-7th-grade) (online due to COVID), a program aimed at helping students from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds gain the resources necessary to succeed mathematically. I assisted with courses on number theory and projective planes, and led activities and check-ins with the students.
### Teaching Assistant Positions
In my work as an undergrad TA, I've taught section, graded HW/exams, and held office hours for the following courses:
*  Calculus III (AS.110.202): Fall 2019
*  Systems and Controls (EN.580.222): Spring 2019
*  Differential Equations and Applications (AS.110.302): Fall 2018, Spring 2019
