## Teaching
### BEAM Summer Away
In July 2020, I served as a counselor and teaching assistant for [BEAM Summer Away](https://www.beammath.org/summer-after-7th-grade) (online due to COVID), a program aimed at helping students from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds gain the resources necessary to succeed mathematically. I assisted with courses on number theory and projective planes, and led activities and check-ins with the students.
### Teaching Assistant Positions
In my work as an undergrad TA, I've taught section, graded HW/exams, and held office hours for the following courses:
*  Calculus III (AS.110.202): Fall 2019
*  Systems and Controls (EN.580.222): Spring 2019
*  Differential Equations and Applications (AS.110.302): Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Spring 2020 

I am very proud to have received awards for my undergrad teaching from both the BME and mathematics departments.


## Mentoring
I serve as a mentor for undergraduate students and prospective graduate students via [Project SHORT] (https://www.project-short.com/) and JHU [Womxn Mentoring Whiting] (https://jhuwmw.carrd.co/).

It takes a village to raise a graduate student. I wouldn't be where I am today without the guidance of my own grad student mentors: [Michael Rosenberg] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcr-biomech), [Franky Romero] (https://web.stanford.edu/~faromero/), and [Blue Sheffer] (http://www.bluesheffer.com/).
