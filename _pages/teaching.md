## Teaching
* ### Stanford Summer Engineering Academy
In 2023, I prepared and taught a four-week inquiry-oriented linear algebra course for a four-week summer bridge program attended by first-generation/low-income and underrepresented incoming freshmen.
* ### Stanford Carpentries
I teach and assist with workshops on programming in Python and R via the Stanford Carpentries, and hold a teaching certification from the international Carpentries network.
* ### Center for Teaching and Learning
I serve as an Engineering Learning Consultant in Stanford's [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://studentlearning.stanford.edu/academic-skills/peer-learning-consultant-program/meet-team). In this role I've helped develop workshops on data visualization and LaTeX. For the past two summers, I have also taught as a co-instructor for a scientific Python bootcamp offered to visiting students in the Stanford Equity & Inclusion Office's summer programs.
* ### Stanford Climbing Wall
I taught belay classes, clinics, and quarter-long introductory courses at the [Stanford Climbing Wall](https://rec.stanford.edu/adventure/climbing).
* ### Additional Calculus for Engineers
In Fall 2021, I held drop-in help hours for students enrolled in CME 102, Ordinary Differential Equations for Engineers, via Stanford's [Additional Calculus for Engineers](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/equity-and-inclusion-initiatives/undergraduate-programs/additional-calculus) program.
* ### BEAM Summer Away
In July 2020, I served as a counselor and teaching assistant for [BEAM Summer Away](https://www.beammath.org/summer-after-7th-grade) (online due to COVID), a program aimed at helping students from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds gain the resources necessary to succeed mathematically. I assisted with courses on number theory and projective planes, and led activities and check-ins with the students.
* ### Undergraduate Teaching Assistant Positions
In my work as an undergrad TA, I've taught section, graded HW/exams, and held office hours for the following courses:
*  Calculus III (AS.110.202): Fall 2019
*  Systems and Controls (EN.580.222): Spring 2019, Spring 2020
*  Differential Equations and Applications (AS.110.302): Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Spring 2020 

I am very proud to have received awards for my undergrad teaching from both the BME and mathematics departments.


## Mentoring
I serve as a mentor for undergraduate students and prospective graduate students via [Project SHORT](https://www.project-short.com/), JHU [Womxn Mentoring Whiting](https://jhuwmw.carrd.co/), Stanford [SWIMM](http://swimm.stanford.edu/), and the Stanford [WCC STEM Program](https://stanfordwcc.weebly.com/wcc-stem-program.html).

Many thanks to my own mentors, who have shaped my experience in academia for the better: [Michael Rosenberg](https://neuromechanicslab.emory.edu/people/rosenberg-michael.html), [Franky Romero](https://web.stanford.edu/~faromero/), [Blue Sheffer](http://www.bluesheffer.com/), and [Stephanie Claussen](https://engineering.sfsu.edu/faculty-profile-stephanie-claussen).
